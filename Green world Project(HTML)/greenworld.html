            The natural environment gives us a wealth of services that are difficult to measure in dollars. The environment is everything that is around us, which includes both living and nonliving things like soil, water, animals, and plants, which adapt themselves to their surroundings. It affects the growth and development of living things. It covers both biotic and abiotic components of the environment. The major components of the environment are the atmosphere (air), lithosphere (rocks and soil), hydrosphere (water), and biosphere (living component of the environment).</p>

                Environment means what surrounds us. It may be living or non-living things. It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces. Living things live in their environment. They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment. In the environment there are different interactions between animals, plants, soil, water, and other living and non-living things. The word environment is used to talk about many things. For example, trees, rivers, and oceans are a part of the environment. People in different fields of knowledge use the word environment differently. Electromagnetic environment is radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation and magnetic fields. The environment of a galaxy may mean the interstellar medium, or it may mean other nearby galaxies.
